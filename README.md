## About Me!

### Computer Science Career :man_technologist: 
I am a passionate first year computer scientist at [The University of Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk) and have experience working on both front-end and back-end development. I'm currently in the Unicorns software engineering team for which you can find the link to our projects at the top. 

### Personal Life 
Based in the UK 

When I'm not programming, you can often find me playing videogames or having fun travelling! 

Travelling and its thrill of exploring new cultures and creating new memories is unmatched. I've had many great times visiting family in the US and Hungary!
